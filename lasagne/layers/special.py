class InverseLayer(MergeLayer):
    """
    The :class:`InverseLayer` class performs inverse operations
    for a single layer of a neural network by applying the
    partial derivative of the layer to be inverted with
    respect to its input: transposed layer
    for a :class:`DenseLayer`, deconvolutional layer for
    :class:`Conv2DLayer`, :class:`Conv1DLayer`; or
    an unpooling layer for :class:`MaxPool2DLayer`.

    It is specially useful for building (convolutional)
    autoencoders with tied parameters.

    Note that if the layer to be inverted contains a nonlinearity
    and/or a bias, the :class:`InverseLayer` will include the derivative
    of that in its computation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    incoming : a :class:`Layer` instance or a tuple
        The layer feeding into this layer, or the expected input shape.
    layer : a :class:`Layer` instance or a tuple
        The layer with respect to which the instance of the
        :class:`InverseLayer` is inverse to.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import lasagne
    >>> from lasagne.layers import InputLayer, Conv2DLayer, DenseLayer
    >>> from lasagne.layers import InverseLayer
    >>> l_in = InputLayer((100, 3, 28, 28))
    >>> l1 = Conv2DLayer(l_in, num_filters=16, filter_size=5)
    >>> l2 = DenseLayer(l1, num_units=20)
    >>> l_u = InverseLayer(l2, l1)  # As Deconv2DLayer
